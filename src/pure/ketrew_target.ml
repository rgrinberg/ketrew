Encoding of the state of a target:
   
- `run_bookkeeping` keeps the information for the `Long_running` plugin.
- `log` is a time stamped optional log message

Every state point to its previous state through a `'a hitory`. 

We use the subtyping of  polymorphic variants to encode the
state-machine; a given state can come only from certain previous
states, those are enforced with the type-parameter of the `history`
value.
